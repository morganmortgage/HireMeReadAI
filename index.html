        structure home financing. The industry is a trillion-dollar maze of disconnected software.
        I want to help Read AI become the decision engine that finally connects it – for buyers,

        <!-- WHY READ AI -->
        <section>
          <h2>Why I’m excited about Read AI</h2>
          <p>
            Today’s mortgage journey is backwards. Buyers fall in love with a home, then scramble for a
            pre-approval, juggle quotes from a few lenders, and try to compare PDFs and fee worksheets at
            midnight. Behind the scenes, loan officers, realtors, and processors are bouncing between systems
            that don’t communicate: LOS, pricing engines, POS, CRM, portals, email, chat, spreadsheets.
          </p>
          <p>
            I live inside that mess every day. Smart buyers overpay or miss opportunities not because they’re
            unqualified, but because the decision layer is broken. Nobody has a single, trusted brain that sits
            across the conversation and the software stack and says: <em>“Here’s what’s really happening, here are
            the best structures for this borrower, and here’s what you should do next.”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Read AI is the closest thing I’ve seen to that missing brain. You already sit across meetings, email,
            and messages; you already summarize the noise and surface what matters. Plug that same copilot into
            the mortgage & real estate stack, and you don’t just save time – you change how home-financing
            decisions get made.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- WHAT I WANT TO BUILD -->
        <section>
          <h2>What I want to build at Read AI</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>A connected decision layer for home financing.</strong>
              Use Read’s position across meetings, email, and messages to build a single source of truth
              for each file: goals, constraints, pricing options, conditions, and trade-offs – one copilot
              view instead of scattered notes and systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consumer-grade clarity on “which option is actually better?”.</strong>
              Turn the mess of loan estimates, fee worksheets, and lender jargon into side-by-side narratives
              a human can understand: what you pay, what you save, the risk, and why one structure is smarter
              for this borrower.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Real-time radar for lenders and realtors.</strong>
              Give teams a live view of which files are stuck, who hasn’t been followed up with, which buyers
              are at risk of drifting to another lender, and where concessions or structure changes can save a deal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vertical playbooks that match reality, not theory.</strong>
              Map how top producers actually work – including the hacks – and design copilot flows that remove
              manual note-taking, status updates, and repetitive explanations from their week.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A data flywheel that gets smarter with every file.</strong>
              Use patterns across thousands of loans and conversations to recommend better structures, spot
              hidden savings, and flag risk earlier – while keeping humans in control of the decision.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <!-- PROOF -->
        <section>
          <h2>Proof I can deliver</h2>
          <p>
            I’m not a software engineer – I’m the operator in the trenches who rebuilt his own process with AI
            and proved it with real money on the line. In 2025 alone, my AI-driven process has saved clients
            over <strong>$110,000</strong> in interest and costs by structuring deals differently – not just
            “shopping a rate,” but rethinking points, credits, mortgage insurance, terms, and timing.

          </div>
          <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
            My goal at Read AI is to take the patterns I’ve proven in my own practice and translate them into
            vertical workflows and products that scale – so thousands of loan officers, realtors, and buyers
            benefit from the same level of decision quality.

          <h2>How I’d start in the first 90 days</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Become an extreme power user.</strong>
              Live in Read across my own meetings, email, and messages; understand every feature and
              limitation through the lens of a loan officer, realtor, and team lead.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Map the real mortgage & real-estate stack.</strong>
              Document how top producers actually work – which tools they touch, where information dies,
              how they hack around gaps – and identify the 3–4 highest-leverage insertion points for Read’s copilot.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Run focused pilots with real teams.</strong>
              Partner with a handful of broker shops and agent teams to test specific workflows
              (pre-approval consults, weekly pipeline reviews, contract-to-close). Measure time saved,
              error reduction, pull-through, and client satisfaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ship a “Read for Mortgage & Real Estate” playbook.</strong>
              Package the winning workflows into a clear vertical story: demo scripts, ROI examples,
              configuration guides, and feedback loops for product and data science.
